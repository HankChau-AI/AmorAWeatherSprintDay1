Created a replication of assigned figma for a weather app. Gets the temperature, weather condition, and date, for any given location entered. Includes a 5 day forecast as well as an favorites button to favorite specific locations. Supports local storage so favorites will be stored. Search function has an autopopulate feature from API for location suggestions. 

Peer Review: Andrew Sayasing
Nice! Everything seems to be populated, functionality all works. There are some minor stuff that isn't wokring, but like you said , you're still tweaking things around.
